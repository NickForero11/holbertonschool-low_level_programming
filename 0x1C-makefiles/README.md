## Description

What you should learn from this project:

* What are make, Makefiles
* When, why and how to use Makefiles
* What are rules and how to set and use them
* What are explicit and implicit rules
* What are the most common / useful rules
* What are variables and how to set and use them

---

### [0. make -f 0-Makefile](./0-Makefile)

* Simple make file that compiles all the source files and produces the executable holberton.

### [1. make -f 1-Makefile](./1-Makefile)

* Makefile that does the same as 0 using variables for the compiler and the source files.

### [2. make -f 2-Makefile](./2-Makefile)

* Makefile that does the same as 1 using variables for the object files and the name of the executable.

### [3. make -f 3-Makefile](./3-Makefile)

* Makefile that does the same as 2 with additional operations to do cleanup of the temporary files objects and force recompilation.

### [4. A complete Makefile](./4-Makefile)

* Makefile that does the same as 3 using variables for the compilation flags.

### [5. Island Perimeter](./5-island_perimeter.py)

* A function that returns the perimeter of the island described in a Grid:

  Grid is a list of list of integers:
  * 0 represents a water zone
  * 1 represents a land zone
  * One cell is a square with side length 1
  * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
  * Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
  * Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
  * The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).
